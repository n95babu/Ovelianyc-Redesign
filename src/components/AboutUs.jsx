          <p>
            Restaurants run in their family. John and Litsa owned an eatery in Athens, Greece, which is where they are from.
            In 1974, John left to help his nephew open a restaurant in Manhattan. Litsa and Chris joined him a year later, and after Peter was born, Litsa became a stay-at-home cook while she raised the boys in Astoria.John worked in other peopleâ€™s restaurants throughout his career. Eleven years ago, when John was near retirement age, the family opened Ovelia, the Hellenic grill house and bar on 30th Avenue at 34th Street.
